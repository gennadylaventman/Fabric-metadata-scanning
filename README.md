# Fabric Metadata Scanning
This solution is for Microsoft Fabric metadata scanning APIs, presenting a simple way to run and get the result of 4 APIs:

* [Modified Workspaces API](#modified-workspaces-api)
* [Workspace Info API](#workspace-info-api)
* [Scan Status API](#scan-status-api)
* [Scan Result API](#scan-result-api)

This is a template. Feel free to adjust and modify it for your needs.
 
## How To Autenticate

### Pre-requirement:

	1. .NET Core
	2. Newtonsoft.Json (nuget)
	3. Microsoft.Identity.Client (nuget)

## How To Run

	1. Clone or download the files.
	2. Set the configurations you would like to use: The system limits are written in the example configuration file. 
	3. Run dotnet run < configuration file path > 
	4. The system will ask you to autheticate with you admin credentials.
	5. After each run, the configuration "modifiedSince" would be set to the current time.

## Modified Workspaces API

	This API get the modified workspaces since modifySince parameter set on the configuration file.This parameter should be on iso8601 format.
	Also Possible to use "alwaysFullScan" flag which ignores the modifySince parameter.
	Saves the output in outputs/ModifiedWorkspaces/< date >.txt as a list of worspaces Ids.

## Workspace Info API

	This API use the output from Modified Workspaces API, take chunk of Ids and sends for scan those ids.
	The chunk size set on the configurationfile(getInfo section)
	Returns the scan Id to the Main function.

## Scan Status API

	This API use the output from Workspace Info API (scanId), and return the scan status.
	The system waits for this API to return "Succeeded".
	 
## Scan Result API

	Once scan succeeded, The system asked for detailed result from this API.
	Each workspace details saved on outputs/< workspaceId >/< scanId >_< date >.json
	Final result report saved on outputs/Results/< date >.json


## Configuration File
	Section for each API - "modified", "getInfo","scanStatus","scanResult".
	More sections: "shared","auth"
